Computer Graphics and Visualization

  I approach the development of software the same I would appreach eating an elephant, which is to say one bite at a time.  When tackling a large project I use incremental coding to break the project up into smaller more manageble units. I have learned that when designing something, whether it be a 3D scene or a piece of software, you have to look at from mulitple angles to see how things fit and hopefully see the things that need may not be important until a few steps down the road in order to account for them.  The design process I followed was Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, and Improve.
I first asked myself, what did I want to achieve in this project, then I imagined what that scene would look like, I laid a plan to tacle the specific objects by breaking them down into simplier shapes, then I created the code to impliment my design, and finally I spent time impoving the overall look of the scene.

  As stated above the design process can be implemented into any software project you are working on and when you get to the coding step you would simply break it down into small step.  It is with almost 100% certainty that I will never use OpenGL again and to that end this class has not helped me any any real way in my pursuit for a degree in computer science and I'm glad to be finished with it forever.
