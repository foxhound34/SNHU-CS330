Computer Graphics and Visualization

  I approach the development of software the same I would appreach eating an elephant, which is to say one bite at a time.  When tackling a large project I use incremental coding to break the project up into smaller more manageble units. I have learned that when designing something, whether it be a 3D scene or a piece of software, you have to look at from mulitple angles to see how things fit and hopefully see the things that need may not be important until a few steps down the road in order to account for them.  The design process i followed was Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, and Improve.
I first asked myself, what did I want to achieve in this project, then I imagined what that scene would look like, I laid a plan to tacle the specific objects by breaking them down into simplier shapes, then I created the code to impliment my design, and finally I spent time impoving the overall look of the scene.
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
